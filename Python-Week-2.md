# Functions

It is a block of code which executes only when it is called.

They are a handy way to creating blocks of code that you can reuse.

To define a function, you use the *def* keyword, followed by *function_name*, parentheses then the body of the function.

a function can one or more arguments.

**parameter vs argument**

a parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses when defining a function.

an argument is the literal value passed to a function, when calling it for execution

in Python, there are two types of variables, Local variables which are defined inside the function. Global variables are defined outside the function in the main block.

**Locals()**
