# Functions

It is a block of code which executes only when it is called.

They are a handy way to creating blocks of code that you can reuse.

To define a function, you use the *def* keyword, followed by *function_name*, parentheses then the body of the function.

a function can one or more arguments.

**parameter vs argument**

a parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses when defining a function.

an argument is the literal value passed to a function, when calling it for execution

# Scope

in Python, there are two types of variables, Local variables which are defined inside the function. Global variables are defined outside the function in the main block.

**Locals()**

Variables defined within the scope of a function, are only accessible to the function and not anywhere outside the function.

**Global**

Variables defined in the main method, not within a function. used anywhere throughout the program.

**Lambda Functions**

A Python function that has only one expression and can't have multiple lines. It is meant to make it easier to create some small logic in one line instead of a whole function.

They are anonymous, meaning there is no need to name them.

*Basic Syntax*

use the *lambda* keyword, define parameters needed, use : to separate parameters from the expression

*lambda arguments: expression*

this example below is a lambda function with one parameter
