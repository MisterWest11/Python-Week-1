# User Stories

Is a simpler way for you to plan out you Python project, the specifics. They depict a small scenarios from a user's perspective and emphasize the user's goal and motivation.

User stories are simple, brief and informal and perfect for jotting down on index cards.

they follow a format "As a (user/role), I want (goal) so that (reason/benefit)."

e.g.    "As a digest recipient, I want to receive an email every morning with current and useful information so that I know what's going on in the world and learn something new each day."

User stories focus on the user's goal and reasons rather than specific interface details.

# Use Cases

Use cases include a title, actor(user or system), and a scenario that describes how a goal is achieved.

User stories and Use cases maybe seem similar, but they capture different info. User stories focus on who, what and why of a task. 

Use cases focus on who, what and how of achieving that goal/task.

# Projects Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the application should do or should not do. Written in as sentences starting with "the application must..."

These requirements act as a checklist to ensure the application meeets all necessary requirements.

We also have non-functional requirements that describe how the application should accomplish its tasks. 

They focus on maintainability, reliability, and usability. e.g. The application should have a configurable GUI for the admin to interact with.
