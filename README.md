Python week-1 commences

Basics of learning Python:
A basic unit of a program is called a variable or a container that holds a value in a program.
An equal sign is used as an assignment operator.
Variable names begin with letters(uppercase or lowercase), traditionally lowercase letters. Can have underscores and numbers but a variable name cannot start with a number.

VARIABLES

There are several types of variables/data types in python
We have integers: which are whole numbers e.g 1,2.5,89,456 etc...

We have floats: which are decimal numbers e.g 0.5, 12.3, 453.03, 3.145 etc...

We have strings: which are a collection of characters e.g "car", "rabbit" etc...

We have complex numbers: which are used for complex mathematical calculations.

We have booleans: which have two values, true/false.

Working with strings, we can use the + sign to combine two strings. We call that concatenation.
