# Basics of learning Python:
A basic unit of a program is called a variable or a container that holds a value in a program.
An equal sign is used as an assignment operator.
Variable names begin with letters(uppercase or lowercase), traditionally lowercase letters. Can have underscores and numbers but a variable name cannot start with a number.

# VARIABLES

There are several types of variables/data types in python
We have integers: which are whole numbers e.g 1,2.5,89,456 etc...

We have floats: which are decimal numbers e.g 0.5, 12.3, 453.03, 3.145 etc...

We have strings: which are a collection of characters e.g "car", "rabbit" etc...

We have complex numbers: which are used for complex mathematical calculations.

We have booleans: which have two values, true/false.

Working with strings, we can use the + sign to combine two strings. We call that concatenation.
Cannot be used to add string and numbers.

In Python we can also assign values to multiple variables in one line. x, y, z = "cat", "dog", "me".

# Output variables
Python uses the print() funtion to output. Outputting multiple variables is separated by a comma inside the parenthesis.

# Global variables
Created outside a function.

now creating a variable inside a function, we use the global keyword.


# DATA STRUCTURES
Data structures allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable. which can contain any data type, including a list within a list.

Tuples are similar to lists, except they cannot be modified once declared.
Useful for storing large amounts of data more efficiently in memory.
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, declared using a curly brace.


# OPERATORS
Instructions that perform operations on variables and values. Used to manipulate and perform actions on data.

- (+) - addition: used to add two values.
- (*) - multiply: used to multiple two values
- ^ - exponent: used as an exponent.
- / - divide: used as a division operator, returns a floating-point value even if result is a whole number..
- % - modulus: provides remainder after division

Strings can also be manipulated, to concatenate we use the plus sign +.
To multiply a word certain number of times we used the multiplication sign.

Comparison operators, logical operators, identity operator and membership operator are another set of operators.

Comparison Operator: evaluate two values and produces a boolean result, either True/False. examples include double equal sign, less-than, less-than or equal-to, greater-than, greater-than or equal-to.

Logical operators: AND, OR & NOT operate on boolean values. The AND operator returns true if both operands are true, while the OR operator returns a true if either of the operands is true. The NOT operator negates the Boolean value it operates on.

Membership operators: IN & NOT IN are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or not. checks if a certain number or string exists in a given list or string.
