Basics of learning Python:
A basic unit of a program is called a variable or a container that holds a value in a program.
An equal sign is used as an assignment operator.
Variable names begin with letters(uppercase or lowercase), traditionally lowercase letters. Can have underscores and numbers but a variable name cannot start with a number.
