In this file, we are doing a summary for both Week 1 & 2 in Python.

# Basic Data types

Data types are classification that tells a computer program how to intepret and utilize information.

In Pytho, we have basic data types that we use to form a solid structure of variables.

there is a string, integer, float, boolean and complex number.

* String is a sequence of characters, represented in a "...".

* Integer are positive or negative whole numbers that can be used in arithmetic operations.

* Floats are positive and negative decimal numbers. also can be used in arithmetic operations.

* Complex numbers represent numbers with a real and imaginary part. they are used in mathematical operations.

* Booleans have to values, True or False. used to instantiate the state of something to be either true or false.


# Variables

variables are a container that stores data. In Python it is followed by an assignment operator and a value.

Python has certain naming conventions that are used in programming.

* a variable cannot start with a number.

* a variable can contain numbers and letters.

* starts with an upper or lower case.

* variables are case sensitive... num and Num are different variables.


In Python, we have local and global variables, where if a variable is declared within the bounds of a function, it is known as a local variable. meaning it can only be accessible with the function, and nowhere else outside the function.

global variables are created outside a function, in the main thread, they can be used at any point of the program.

to display to the console, we use the print() function.

# Operators

operators are instructions that perform operations on values and variables on manipulating data, performing calculations.

We have :

* Arithmetic Operators: that are used for mathematical numeric operations. [+, -, /, *, %,**,//]

* Comparison Operators: used to compare values and return a boolean true/false. [==, !=, >=, >, <, <=]

* Logical Operators: Combine boolean expressions to form one complex condition. [and, or, not]

* Assignment Operators: used to assign values to variables. [=, +=, -=, *=]

* Identity Operators: used to check object identity. [is, is not]

* Membership Operators: used to check if a value is present in a sequence. [in, not in]

* Bitwise Operators: perform operations on bits within integers. [&, |, ^, ~, >>, <<]


# Control Flow

This refers to the order in which the program executes.
